# Project 0

In this project, I made a simple cooking page based on dishes I cooked recently. In all the files, there is a navbar containing "My Cooking Page" and a link to the homepage. 

index.html:
This is my homepage, where I included a short description of the page and a list of 3 categories of dishes: side dish, main dish, dessert, each with a specific dish that's linked to its own html page. I used Bootstrap's grid model to format this list (in styles.scss), so that  each category and its appropriate dish appear in a column format on a small screen and in a row format on a large screen. 
——
The files with dishes all have list of the 3 different dishes with links to their respective pages right below this, as well as a uniform heading using monospace font with a black border but a unique background color (done in styles.scss). A the bottom, there is a link to the official recipe I followed.

potatosalad.html:
Includes (from top to bottom): a picture of the potato salad I made and an unordered list with the ingredients.

pasta.html:
Includes: a picture of the pasta I made, a 2x2 table with the ingredients for each part of the dish.

carrotcake.html:
Includes: a picture of the cake I made, and a visual depiction of the process of making it with links to each section using an id for each image.

styles.scss
All the formatting is done here, from color to font size and type. Uses classes, variables, nesting, inheritance, etc.
