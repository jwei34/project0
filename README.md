# Project 0

In this project, I made a simple cooking page based on dishes I cooked recently.

index.html:
This is my homepage, wehre I included a short description of the page and a list of 3 categories of dishes: side dish, main dish, dessert, each with a specific dish that's linked to its own html page. I used Bootstrap's grid model to format this list, so that  each category and its appropriate dish appear in a column format on a small screen and in a row format on a large screen. There are links to these on all the different pages.
